# Dance School Portal

Dance School Portal is a student/teacher/admin portal for - you guessed it - a dance school. Students can see grades, teachers can grade students, and various other administrative actions are possible depending on the user's role.

The app is set up in a Demo mode: you can select any user to view the app as that user.  This allows for easy exploration of the user role functionality that controls data access.
